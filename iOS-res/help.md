## INTRODUCTION

MAME4iOS Reloaded is developed by David Valdeita (Seleuco), port of MAME 0.139u1 emulator by Nicola Salmoria and [TEAM](#PORT-CREDITS).

MAME4iOS Reloaded emulates arcade games supported by original MAME 0.139u1.

This MAME4iOS version is targeted at 64bit devies (A7 or higher, iPhone 5s or later) , because it is based on a high specs 2010 PC MAME build. Anyway don't expect arcade games of the 90 to work at full speed. Some games are really bad optimized (like outrun or mk series). This is related to MAME build used, since it is targeted to high specs PC's as i said before. This version doesn't have an UML backend ARM dynamic recompiler, which means drivers based on high specs arcade CPUs won't be playable (it has not sense since this games will be slow in any case).

**TIP** You can try to use speed hacks from the `MAME Configure` menu to make playables some games like CPS3 ones.

Said that, with a low end device, use at your own risk. I suggest you use iMAME4all (0.37b5) instead. Remember that games that can be emulated on both versions will run much faster on iMAME4all (0.37b5) than on MAME4iOS Reloaded (0.139u1), and will drain less battery.

This version emulates over 8000 different romsets.

Please, try to understand that that with that amount of games, some will run better than others and some might not even run with MAME4iOS Reloaded. Please, don't email me asking for a specific game to run.

After installing, place your MAME-titled zipped roms in the top folder, use iTunes file sharing, Files.app, built in WebServer or AirDrop (select Open in MAME4iOS).

MAME4iOS Reloaded uses only '0.139u1' romset.

## CONTROLS

The emulator controls are the following ones:

**Virtual pad** Movement in pad, mouse and analog control of the four players.

**Buttons B,X,A,Y,L,R** Buttons A,B,C,D,E,F.

**Buttons START+COIN** (pressed simultaneously) Access to the MAME menu.

**Button COIN** Insert credits (UP+COIN = 2P credits, RIGHT+COIN = 3P credits, DOWN+COIN = 4P credits).

**Button START** Start (UP+START = 2P start, RIGHT+START = 3P start, DOWN+START = 4P start).

**Button EXIT** Exit to selection menu to select another game.

**Button MENU** Open MAME4iOS menu, global settings.

**NOTE** To type OK when MAME requires it, press LEFT and then RIGHT.

## GLOBAL OPTIONS

**FIlter** the method used to expand the emulator screen.
- **Nearest** Dont appy any filtering, aka `FatBits`
- **Linear**  Apply a smoothing image filter over the emulator screen.

**Skin** choose the artwork and layout of the onscreen controlls. 
- **Default** - the default MAME4iOS look.
- **Light Border** - Default + a bright thick border
- **Dark Border** - Default + a think dark border
- **Classic** - the old MAME4iOS look.

**Screen Shader**  effect to apply to the emulator screen. 
- **None** dont use any effect.
- **Default** use the default `simpleTron`.
- **simpleTron** simple CRT effect.
- **megaTron** more advanced CRT effect.
- **ulTron** even more advanced CRT effect.

**Vector Shader** effect to apply to vector games. 
- **None** dont use any effect.
- **Default** use the default `lineTron`.
- **lineTron** simple vector effect with fade out.

**Full Screen** Uses all available screen or shows the emulator windowed.

**Full Screen with Controler** automaticly enters Full Screen when a controler, keyboard, iCade is detected.

**Keep Aspect Ratio** 'Enabled' keeps the aspect ratio; 'Disabled' will use all available screen.

**Integer Scaling Only** 'Enabled' will only scale image by integer amounts.

**Change Current Layout** Changes the current touch controller current layout.

**Reset Current Layout to Default** Restores the current layout.

**Animated** Animates ON/OFF DPad/Stick. Disable to gain performance.

**Touch Type** Set the touch stick to works as analog stick, digital stick or dpad.

**Stick Type** Limits the joystick's range of motion: 8-way,4-way,2-way The most common reason to use a gate in an actual arcade setting is the retrofitting of an older machine that is not compatible with a new 8-way stick. A classic example of this is Pac-Man. The game was originally designed for a 4-way stick, and is programmed to respond only when a new input occurs. If the user is holding the stick in the down position, then suddenly makes a motion to move to the right, what often happens is that the stick first moves into the down-right diagonal, which the game does not recognize as new input since down is still being held. However, right is also now considered held, and when the user completes the motion to move right, it is also not a new input, and Pac-Man will still be moving down.

**Full Screen Buttons** Show 1-4/6 Buttons: Hide/show B/Y/A/X/L/R buttons if needed.

**Button A = B + X** Select it to use A button as B and X simultaneous press.

**Buttons Size** Lets you change the touch buttons size.

**Fullscreen Stick Size** Lets you change the stick size (not DPAD) on lanscape or portrait fullscreen mode.

**Nintendo Button Layout** if enabled the üÖê üÖë and üÖß üÖ® buttons will be swapped to match a Nintendo layout.  This option has no effect on a physical game controller.

**External Controller** Enable external controller: iCade, iControlPad as iCade mode or iMpulse.

**P4,P3,P2 as P1** Send Player 1 input data to Player2,3,4 so you can use the 2-4 players at the same time. Funny :). It makes some weird problems with some roms like D&D.

**Button B as Autofire** If enabled, press B to switch autofire on/off.

**DPAD Touch DZ** Enable/Disable a deadzone on DPAD touch center. It could be better for some games. Disable if you don't like it.

**Stick Touch DZ** Touch stick deadzone selector. Lower to gets more sensitivity.

**Sound** Enable or set the default sound rate for games.

**Cheats** Enables the reading of the cheat database, if present, and the Cheat menu in the user interface.

**Save Hiscores** If enabled, saves hiscores on some games not saving on NVRAM. It could cause problems with some games or save states.

**Show FPS** Shows ON/OFF fps.

**Force Pixel Aspect** Enable it to force pixel aspect ratio bypassing MAME video selection.

**Show Info/Warnings** Shows Game Info and any warnings when a game is selected.

## iCADE (or compatible)
<img src="iCadeControls.png" width=100%>

The best way to use iCade with MAME4iOS is in fullscreen portrait mode, hit the option button and choose options. The onscreen controls will fade out when you start using the iCade buttons. Tap the screen to get MAME4iOS menu.

If the iCade is off (the fake coin slot light is off) just hit an iCade button or move the joystick.(you must have paired the iCade via bluetooth before)

Thanks to Todd Laney for sending me patches, and Martijn Bosschaart who has supported me to get the iCade HW.

## iMpulse

MAME4iOS works correctly out of the box for iMpulse, also has built-in support for local multiplayer (TwiMpulse). Anayway, if you need to redefine second player buttons, you should press coin (left shoulder button) before so MAME4iOS initializes second iMpulse controller.

## XInput Controller

If you have an XInput compatible controller, use `Settings` > `Accessibility` > `Switch Control` > `Switches` > `Bluetooth Devices` to pair controller, then use as normal in MAME4iOS.

## TV-OUT

To connect an iPad or iPhone to your TV or a projector, you can either use the Apple HDMI, Component AV Cable, Apple Composite AV Cable, Apple Dock Connector to VGA Adapter, or other compatible cable.

When the cable is connected to a TV or projector, MAME4iOS will automatically use it when playing a game.

## ROM INSTALLATION

use `Import...`, `Start Web Server`, or `Import from iCloud` from `MAME4iOS` `Settings` 


## MANUAL ROM INSTALLATION

use iTunes file sharing (if your MAME4iOS build has it available) or Files.app, or a 3rd party app like iFunBox or iExplorer to copy ROMs on sandboxed MAME4iOS 'Documents' folder:

Step 1\. Downloaded iFunBox (or a similar utility) and plug your iOS device into your computer.

Step 2\. Launch iFunBox and select your iOS device on the left hand side.

Step 3\. click on apps icon. Now you should see a list of all of your device‚Äôs applications. Locate MAME4iOS, click it, and select Documents.

Step 4\. And that‚Äôs all there is to it. Move your ROMs into this folder, launch MAME4iOS, and start playing!

## Mixing 139 and 2xx ROMs
Some `romsets` are not compatible between MAME 139 and newer versions, the best way to use both `romsets` at the same time is to make sure the newer ones are stored in the `7z` format and the 139 ones in the `zip` format.  This way both files can co-exist.



## DIRECTORIES

| | |  
-|-
`artwork/` | Artwork directory
`titles/` | Title images directory
`cfg/` | MAME configuration files directory
`hi/` | Hiscores directory (MAME 139)

## SUPPORTED GAMES

The 139 version of `MAME4iOS` requires '0.139u1' compatible [romsets](https://archive.org/details/MAME_2010_full_nonmerged_romsets). 

The latest version of `MAME4iOS` requires romsets compatible with the latest `MAME` version.

You can find `MAME` version `MAME4iOS` is using by opening `Settings`.

Games (zip files) have to be imported into the `roms/` folder.

## ROM NAMES

**NOTE** File and directory names in iOS are case-sensitive. Put all file and directory names using lower case!.

## SOUND SAMPLES

The sound samples are used to get complete sound in some of the oldest games. They are placed into the 'samples' directory compressed into ZIP files. The directory and the ZIP files are named using low case!.

## ARTWORK

Starting with the release of MAME 0.107 in July 2006, thanks to Aaron Giles, MAME supports hi-resolution artwork for bezels, backdrops, overlays, marquees, control panels, instruction cards, etc., and includes a new file format for the layout (.lay)

Save these [files](http://mameworld.info/mrdo/mame_artwork.php) to your MAME4iOS `artwork` directory, or import via AirDrop.

## MAME4iOS LICENSE

MAME4iOS is released under a dual-license (GPL / MAME license) of your choice. Under the GPL license in addition you have some extra rights granted by a special license exception which allow you to link the MAME4iOS GPL source with the not GPL MAME source. The exception also gives you the rights to eliminate it if you don't like it or if you want to include the MAME4iOS source in another GPL program. So, MAME4iOS is 100% GPL. You can more easily think at it as a sort of double license. A GPL or a GPL + exception. You have all the rights of the GPL, and, if you want, some others. The only limitation is for MAME4iOS.
